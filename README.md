# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we used Panda and python to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type whether that be Urban, Suburban, or Rural cities. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that showes the total fares for each week by city type from January to early May of 2019. This analysis could help PyBer teams to make a decision.

## Results

#### Multiple Line Chart
According to the following multiple line graph, we could find urban cities have the highest fares and rural cities have the lowest volume throughout this period. Moreover, it is clear all cities have a high peak around the third week of February.
